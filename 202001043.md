1. Identify the Functional and Non-Functional requirements for the given system
<br /><br /><br />
● Functional requirements
<br /><br />
-> Users can login with their id, password and allow them to change their passwords<br />
-> Librarian can add and remove new users and to update the records of available books<br />
-> Readers can search for books and have functionality to filter the books according to author, date etc.<br />
-> Librarian can fine the readers for due books <br />
-> Readers can request librarian for a book to make it available for readers<br />
-> There should be an automatic system to give the notification to reader about the overdue books <br />
-> Readers can know the time after which a book will be available if book is already taken<br />
<br />
● Non-Functional requirements 
<br /><br />
-> Library Information System (LIS) should be a web application built using HTML5 and can be accesed by the users using any browsers as an interface<br />
-> System should only be available if the user is in the institute LAN to reducethe security risk of the software<br />
-> The system should be available for all the user for 24 hours a day and working days a week<br />
-> The system should be real time so that if more than one readers try to issue same book than it should be able to handle that errors accurately<br />
-> Final web-app should provide user-friendly GUI.<br />
-> The system has to be 100% reliable because it might contain confidential information so the product needs to be safe<br />

<br /><br /><br />

2. Identify Scope, Features and Non-Functional aspects :
<br /><br /><br />

● Scope :
<br /><br />
-> We can design a product which can take the input from envionment of noise signals and display the alerts to the user.<br />
-> The product will contain a noise senser which will detect any types of alerts from the nearby objects and then process that signal using Artificial Inteligence to recognize key sound events<br />
-> The final alert will be displayed on the screen of the user so that user will know the final notification.<br />

<br />
●Features :
<br /><br />
-> The App will alert the user through some vibrations or by displaying the object. <br />
-> The latency of the product should be less than a second.<br />
-> The users should be able to add additional sounds which have to be recognized by the AI and alert the user when detected<br />
-> The app should be able to track the live location of users that can be sent to friends and family in emergency situations<br />

<br /><br />
●Non-Functional requirements :
<br /><br />
-> The predictions of the product which is done by AI should be very accurate because it might put user into very dangerous consequences.<br />
-> The App should consume less power and should have little The App should take some response from the user when a critical situation is detected<br />
-> To ensure that the user has been alerted, notify friends and family in case when no response from the user in an emergency situations<br />
